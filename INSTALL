Installation
------------

Just compile the Sombre theme with : 

	make

Now you should have a Sombre.theme bundle. 

Install it in ~/GNUStep/Library/Themes with 

 make install GNUSTEP_INSTALLATION_DOMAIN=USER
 
 or become root and  install it in the LOCAL domain with :
 
 make install
 
 

After that, you need to tell GNUstep to use the 
theme bundle: 

  defaults write NSGlobalDomain GSTheme Sombre
  

The theme uses NSMacintoshInterfaceStyle (global menubar) by defaults.
The menubar is transparent (if used with a compositing manager as compton) because I wrote Sombre to be used with a persistent menubar at the top the screen : TopBar (gnustep menus disappear when no gnustep app has the focus, but TopBar will stay). You can find TopBar at : https://github.com/BertrandDekoninck/TopBar.

If you don't want to use macmenus, ou can force the use of Next menus with :

defaults write NSGlobalDomain NSMenuInterfaceStyle NSNextStepInterfaceStyle

Or you can force the use of inwindow menus with :

defaults write NSGlobalDomain NSMenuInterfaceStyle NSWindows95InterfaceStyle
